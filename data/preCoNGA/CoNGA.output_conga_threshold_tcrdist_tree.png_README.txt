This is a TCRdist hierarchical clustering tree
for the clonotypes with CoNGA score less than 10.0.
The tree is colored by CoNGA score
with a color score range of 1.00e+01 (blue) to 1.00e-08 (red).
For coloring, CoNGA scores are log-transformed, negated, and square-rooted
(with an offset in there, too, roughly speaking).
