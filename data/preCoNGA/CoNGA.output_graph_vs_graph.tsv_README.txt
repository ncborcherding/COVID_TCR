Graph vs graph analysis looks for correlation between GEX and TCR space
by finding statistically significant overlap between two similarity graphs,
one defined by GEX similarity and one by TCR sequence similarity.

Overlap is defined one node (clonotype) at a time by looking for overlap
between that node's neighbors in the GEX graph and its neighbors in the
TCR graph. The null model is that the two neighbor sets are chosen
independently at random.

CoNGA looks at two kinds of graphs: K nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs, where
K = neighborhood size is specified as a fraction of the number of
clonotypes (defaults for K are 0.01 and 0.1), and cluster graphs, where
each clonotype is connected to all the other clonotypes in the same
(GEX or TCR) cluster. Overlaps are computed 3 ways (GEX KNN vs TCR KNN,
GEX KNN vs TCR cluster, and GEX cluster vs TCR KNN), for each of the
K values (called nbr_fracs short for neighbor fractions).

Columns (depend slightly on whether hit is KNN v KNN or KNN v cluster):
conga_score = P value for GEX/TCR overlap * number of clonotypes
mait_fraction = fraction of the overlap made up of 'invariant' T cells
num_neighbors* = size of neighborhood (K)
cluster_size = size of cluster (for KNN v cluster graph overlaps)
clone_index = 0-index of clonotype in adata object
