This plot summarizes the results of a graph
versus features analysis by labeling the clonotypes at the center of
each biased neighborhood with the name of the feature biased in that
neighborhood. The feature names are drawn in colored boxes whose
color is determined by the strength and direction of the feature score bias
(from bright red for features that are strongly elevated to bright blue
for features that are strongly decreased in the corresponding neighborhoods,
relative to the rest of the dataset).

At most one feature (the top scoring) is shown for each clonotype
(ie, neighborhood). The UMAP xy coordinates for this plot are
stored in adata.obsm['X_tcr_2d']. The score used for ranking correlations
is 'mwu_pvalue_adj'. The threshold score for displaying a feature is
1.0. The feature column is 'feature'. Since
we also run graph-vs-features using "neighbor" graphs that are defined
by clusters, ie where each clonotype is connected to all the other
clonotypes in the same cluster, some biased features may be associated with
a cluster rather than a specific clonotype. Those features are labeled with
a '*' at the end and shown near the centroid of the clonotypes belonging
to that cluster.
