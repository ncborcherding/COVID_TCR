This table stores significant matches between
TCRs in adata and TCRs in the file /Users/Nick/conga/conga/data/new_paired_tcr_db_for_matching_nr.tsv

P values of matches are assigned by turning the raw TCRdist
score into a P value based on a model of the V(D)J rearrangement
process, so matches between TCRs that are very far from germline
(for example) are assigned a higher significance.

Columns:

tcrdist: TCRdist distance between the two TCRs (adata query and db hit)

pvalue_adj: raw P value of the match * num query TCRs * num db TCRs

fdr_value: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR value for match

clone_index: index within adata of the query TCR clonotype

db_index: index of the hit in the database being matched

va,ja,cdr3a,vb,jb,cdr3b

db_XXX: where XXX is a field in the literature database
