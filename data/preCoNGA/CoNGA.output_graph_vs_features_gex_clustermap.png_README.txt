This plot shows the distribution of significant
    features from graph-vs-features or HotSpot analysis plotted across the
    GEX landscape. Rows are features and columns are
    individual clonotypes. Columns are ordered by hierarchical clustering
    (if a dendrogram is present above the heatmap) or by a 1D UMAP projection
    (used for very large datasets or if 'X_pca_gex' is not present in
    adata.obsm_keys()). Rows are ordered by hierarchical clustering with
    a correlation metric.

    The row colors to the left of the heatmap show the feature type
    (blue=TCR, orange=GEX). The row colors to the left of those
    indicate the strength of the graph-vs-feature correlation
    (also included in the feature labels to the right of the heatmap;
    keep in mind that highly significant P values for some features may shift
    the colorscale so everything else looks dark blue).

    The column colors above the heatmap are GEX clusters
    (and TCR V/J genes if plotting against the TCR landscape). The text
    above the column colors provides more info.

    Feature scores are Z-score normalized and then averaged over the
    K=54 nearest neighbors (0 means no nbr-averaging).

    The 'coolwarm' colormap is centered at Z=0.

    Since features of the same type (GEX or TCR) as the landscape and
    neighbor graph (ie GEX features) are more highly
    correlated over graph neighborhoods, their neighbor-averaged scores
    will show more extreme variation. For this reason, the nbr-averaged
    scores for these features from the same modality as the landscape
    itself are downscaled by a factor of
    rescale_factor_for_self_features=0.33.

    The colormap in the top left is for the Z-score normalized,
    neighbor-averaged scores (multiply by 3.03
    to get the color scores for the GEX features).
