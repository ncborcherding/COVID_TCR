HotSpot analysis (Nir Yosef lab, PMID: 33951459)
was used to identify a set of GEX (TCR) features that showed biased
distributions in TCR (GEX) space. This plot shows the distribution of the
top-scoring HotSpot features on the GEX
UMAP 2D landscape. The features are ranked by adjusted P value
(raw P value * number of comparisons). The raw scores for each feature
are averaged over the K nearest neighbors (K is indicated in the lower
right corner of each panel) for each clonotype. The min and max
nbr-averaged scores are shown in the upper corners of each panel.

Features are filtered based on correlation coefficient to reduce
redundancy: if a feature has a correlation of >= 0.9
(the max_feature_correlation argument to conga.plotting.plot_hotspot_umap)
to a previously plotted feature, that feature is skipped.
Points are plotted in order of increasing feature score
