 This table stores the results of the TCR "clumping"
analysis, which looks for neighborhoods in TCR space with more TCRs than
expected by chance under a simple null model of VDJ rearrangement.

For each TCR in the dataset, we count how many TCRs are within a set of
fixed TCRdist radii (defaults: 24,48,72,96), and compare that number
to the expected number given the size of the dataset using the poisson
model. Inspired by the ALICE and TCRnet methods.

Columns:
clump_type='global' unless we are optionally looking for TCR clumps within
   the individual GEX clusters
num_nbrs = neighborhood size (number of other TCRs with TCRdist<nbr_radius)
pvalue_adj= raw Poisson P value of the neighborhood size multiplied by
   the number of TCRs in the dataset and the number of radii
clonotype_fdr_value= Benjamin-Hochberg FDR value for the per-TCR
   significance (ie, looking at all the radii).
