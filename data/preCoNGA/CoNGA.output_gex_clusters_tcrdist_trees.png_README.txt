These are TCRdist hierarchical clustering trees
for the GEX clusters (cluster assignments stored in
adata.obs['clusters_gex']). The trees are colored by CoNGA score
with a color score range of 5.45e+01 (blue) to 5.45e-08 (red).
For coloring, CoNGA scores are log-transformed, negated, and square-rooted
(with an offset in there, too, roughly speaking).
