Graph-versus-feature analysis was used to identify
a set of TCR features that showed biased distributions
in GEX neighborhoods. This plot shows the distribution of the
top-scoring TCR features on the GEX
UMAP 2D landscape. The features are ranked by 'mwu_pvalue_adj' ie
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon adjusted P value (raw P value * number of comparisons).
At most 3 features from clonotype neighbhorhoods
in each (GEX,TCR) cluster pair are shown. The raw scores for each feature
are averaged over the K nearest neighbors (K is indicated in the lower
right corner of each panel) for each clonotype. The min and max
nbr-averaged scores are shown in the upper corners of each panel.
Points are plotted in order of increasing feature score.
